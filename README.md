**Everything is going to be as open source as possible. Since our project will be created using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)/[Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org), we will provide screenshots/snippets of code if code is not able to be viewed for any reason, and we will give instructions on how to view our project/code if that is something you would like to do.**

# 2) Project Plans
**We are going to assign roles for our project to help keep production smooth, and keep the creation process neat. Below, you will be able to view everyone who is working on this project, and their role.**
